# Java Socket Chat

This is a chat application that allows multiple clients to connect to a server and communicate with each other in
real-time.

## Client

The `Client` class represents the client-side of the chat application. It has the following methods:

- `sendMessage`: This method allows the client to send messages to the server.
- `listenForMessage`: This method starts a new thread that listens for incoming messages from the server and prints them
  to the console.
- `closeEverything`: This method closes all resources (socket, buffered reader, and buffered writer) used by the client.

The `main` method of the `Client` class creates a new socket and connects to the server at localhost on
port `Config.ROOM_PORT`. It then creates a new `Client` object and starts two threads: one for sending messages and
another for listening for messages from the server.

## ClientHandler

The `ClientHandler` class represents the server-side of the chat application. It has the following methods:

- `broadcastMessage`: This method sends a message to all other clients connected to the server, except for the client
  that sent the message.

The `ClientHandler` class also implements the `Runnable` interface, which means that it can be executed by a separate
thread. The `run` method of the `ClientHandler` class listens for incoming messages from the client and broadcasts the
message to all other clients connected to the server.

## Config

The `Config` class contains constants that are used by both the client and the server. It has the following constant:

- `ROOM_PORT`: This is the port number used by the server to listen for incoming connections from clients.

## Server

The `Server` class represents the server-side of the chat application. It has the following methods:

- `startServer`: This method starts the server and listens for incoming connections from clients. When a client
  connects, it creates a new `ClientHandler` object to handle the client's communication with the server.

## SocketHelper

The `SocketHelper` class provides utility methods for closing resources (sockets, buffered readers, and buffered
writers). It has the following method:

- `closeResources`: This method closes all resources (socket, buffered reader, and buffered writer) passed to it as
  arguments.
